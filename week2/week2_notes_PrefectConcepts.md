# Introduction to Prefect Concepts

## Prefect
- **Prefect** = a modern open source dataflow automation platform that allows one to add observability and orchestration by utilizing Python to write code as **workflows** in order to build, run, and monitor pipelines at scale.

## Creating the environment
- Create a conda environment: `conda create -n zoom python=3.9`
- *In an Anaconda command window*, activate the environment: `conda activate zoom`
- Install the requirements found in `requirements.txt` via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
